# TriviaGame
Overview-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
trivia game with timer
Utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery to build out this project.
Description-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After clicking the start button a 15 second timer begins counting down, and the first question appears. There are four options and one correct answer. 
If the correct answer is selected, a Fallout video game Gif will play with an accompanying message will appear, congradulating the user.
If an incorrect answer is selected, an explosion gif will play and a message will appear, informing the user that they guessed the wrong answer.
Challenges----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most challenging aspects of this project were getting the GIFS to play after a correct or inccorrect answer was selected. This was a very time-consuming challenge that was caused by scope issues. Once I was able to place things within the correct scope, they worked properly. An additional issue I faced was styling this app, which resulted in a lot of work in developer tools. I was able to overcome this task spending a lot of time testing different css techniques.
